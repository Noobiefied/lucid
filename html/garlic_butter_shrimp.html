          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p class="instructions-text">
            Here are the instructions to prepare this delacacy:
          </p>
          <ul class="instructions-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Prepare the shrimp: </strong>Pat the shrimp completely dry
              with paper towels. This is important for getting a good sear.
              Season both sides with salt and pepper.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Heat the pan: </strong>In a large skillet, heat 1
              tablespoon of butter and the olive oil over medium-high heat until
              the butter is melted and the pan is hot but not smoking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sear the shrimp: </strong>Add the shrimp in a single
              layer, making sure not to overcrowd the pan (work in batches if
              necessary). Cook for about 2 minutes on the first side without
              moving them, until they're pink and slightly golden.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Flip and finish: </strong>Flip the shrimp and cook for
              another 1-2 minutes until the other side is pink and the shrimp
              are just cooked through. They should be opaque and slightly
              curled. Be careful not to overcook—shrimp cook very quickly and
              become rubbery if overdone. Transfer the cooked shrimp to a plate.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Make the garlic butter sauce: </strong>Reduce the heat to
              medium and add the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter to the same
              skillet. Once melted, add the minced garlic and red pepper flakes
              if using. Sauté for about 30-60 seconds, stirring constantly,
              until the garlic is fragrant but not browned.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Deglaze(optional): </strong>If using wine or broth, pour
              it into the pan and let it simmer for about 1 minute, scraping up
              any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. This adds extra
              flavor to your sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Finish the sauce: </strong>Add the lemon juice and stir to
              combine. Let the sauce simmer for another minute to reduce
              slightly and concentrate the flavors.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Combine and serve: </strong>Return the shrimp to the
              skillet and toss them in the garlic butter sauce until well coated
              and heated through, about 1 minute. Sprinkle with fresh chopped
              parsley and toss again.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Plate and garnish: </strong>Transfer to a serving dish and
              spoon any remaining sauce over the top. Serve immediately with
              lemon wedges on the side.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>TIP: </strong>Serve over pasta, rice, or with crusty bread
            to soak up the delicious garlic butter sauce. You can also add a
            splash of heavy cream to make it extra decadent. For best results,
            use fresh (not frozen) shrimp if possible, and don't skip the step
            of patting them dry.
