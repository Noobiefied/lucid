          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p class="instructions-text">
            Here are the instructions to prepare this delacacy:
          </p>
          <ul class="instructions-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Preheat and prepare: </strong>Preheat your oven to 350°F
              (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with butter or non-stick
              spray, or line it with parchment paper for easy removal.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mash the bananas: </strong>In a large mixing bowl, mash
              the ripe bananas with a fork until they're mostly smooth with just
              a few small lumps. You should have about 1½ cups of mashed banana.
              The riper and more spotty your bananas, the sweeter and more
              flavorful your bread will be.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mix in the butter: </strong>Stir the melted butter into
              the mashed bananas until well combined. The butter should be
              melted but not hot, or it might scramble the egg in the next step.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add sugar, egg and vanilla: </strong>Mix in the sugar,
              beaten egg, and vanilla extract. Stir until everything is well
              incorporated and the mixture is smooth.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add the leavening: </strong>Sprinkle the baking soda and
              salt over the banana mixture and stir to combine. You might see
              the mixture fizz slightly—this is normal and shows the baking soda
              is activated.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fold in the flour: </strong>Add the flour (and cinnamon if
              using) and gently fold it in with a wooden spoon or spatula. Stir
              just until no flour streaks remain—do not overmix! Overmixing
              develops the gluten and makes the bread tough and dense. A few
              small lumps are okay.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add mix-ins: </strong>If using walnuts or chocolate chips,
              gently fold them into the batter.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Pour and bake: </strong> Pour the batter into your
              prepared loaf pan and smooth the top with a spatula. Tap the pan
              gently on the counter a couple times to release any air bubbles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bake: </strong> Bake for 55-65 minutes, or until a
              toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean or with just a
              few moist crumbs (but no wet batter). The top should be deep
              golden brown. If the top is browning too quickly but the center
              isn't done, tent it loosely with aluminum foil for the last 15-20
              minutes of baking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cool: </strong> Remove the pan from the oven and let the
              banana bread cool in the pan for about 10-15 minutes. Then turn it
              out onto a wire rack to cool completely. This makes it easier to
              slice cleanly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Slice and serve: </strong> Once cooled, slice and enjoy!
              Banana bread is delicious warm with a pat of butter, or at room
              temperature. It also makes excellent toast the next day.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>Storage: </strong>Wrap cooled banana bread tightly in
            plastic wrap or store in an airtight container at room temperature
            for up to 4 days, or in the refrigerator for up to a week. It also
            freezes beautifully for up to 3 months—wrap it tightly in plastic
            wrap and then aluminum foil before freezing.
          </p>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>TIP: </strong>Don't throw away those overripe bananas! When
            your bananas get too spotty to eat, peel them and freeze them in a
            freezer bag. When you're ready to make banana bread, just thaw them,
            they'll be perfect. For extra moisture, you can add a dollop of sour
            cream or Greek yogurt to the batter. For a fun twist, try swirling
            in some Nutella or peanut butter before baking.
