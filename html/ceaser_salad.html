            <li>2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped</li>
            <li>2-3 anchovy fillets (or 1 teaspoon anchovy paste)</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>

            <li>⅓ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>
              Salt to taste (be careful, anchovies and Parmesan are salty)
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p class="instructions-text">
            Here are the instructions to prepare this delacacy:
          </p>
          <ul class="instructions-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Prepare your base: </strong> In a food processor or
              blender, combine the garlic and anchovy fillets. Pulse several
              times until they form a paste. If you don't have a food processor,
              you can mince the garlic very finely and mash it with the
              anchovies using the back of a fork on a cutting board with a pinch
              of salt.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add acidic ingredients: </strong>Add the lemon juice,
              Dijon mustard, and egg yolk to the food processor. The egg yolk
              acts as an emulsifier, helping to create a creamy, stable
              dressing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Blend: </strong>Process or blend for about 30 seconds
              until the mixture is smooth and well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Emulsify with oil: </strong>With the food processor or
              blender running on low speed, very slowly drizzle in the olive oil
              through the feed tube. Start with just a few drops, then increase
              to a thin, steady stream as the mixture begins to emulsify. This
              gradual process is crucial for creating a thick, creamy dressing.
              The whole process should take about 2-3 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
              <strong>Add cheese and seasonings: </strong>Once all the oil is
              incorporated and the dressing is thick and creamy, add the grated
              Parmesan cheese, Worcestershire sauce, and black pepper. Pulse a
              few times until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adjust consistency and seasoning: </strong>Taste the
              dressing and add salt if needed (remember, it's probably already
              quite salty from the anchovies and Parmesan). If the dressing is
              too thick, you can thin it with a tablespoon of water or
              additional lemon juice. If it's too thin, you can add a bit more
              Parmesan.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Store or serve: </strong>Transfer to an airtight container
              and refrigerate until ready to use. The dressing will thicken
              slightly when chilled. It will keep for up to 3-4 days in the
              refrigerator.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Toss the salad: </strong>When ready to serve, toss the
              dressing with crisp romaine lettuce, additional Parmesan shavings,
              and croutons for a classic Caesar salad.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>Safety Note: </strong>This recipe contains raw egg yolk. To
            reduce the risk of foodborne illness, use pasteurized eggs, or you
            can substitute with ¼ cup of mayonnaise (which is made from
            pasteurized eggs) instead of the egg yolk for a safer version.
          </p>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>TIP: </strong>For the best flavor, use good quality Parmesan
            cheese and freshly squeezed lemon juice. Don't skip the
            anchovies—they provide essential umami flavor without making the
            dressing taste fishy. If you're really opposed to anchovies, you can
            increase the Worcestershire sauce, but the authentic flavor will be
            missing.
