          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p class="instructions-text">
            Here are the instructions to prepare this delacacy:
          </p>
          <ul class="instructions-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Prepare the avocados: </strong>Cut the avocados in half
              lengthwise and remove the pits. Use a spoon to scoop the flesh
              into a medium mixing bowl.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mash the avocados: </strong>Add the lime juice and salt to
              the avocados. Using a fork or potato masher, mash the avocados to
              your desired consistency. Some people prefer it chunky with
              visible pieces of avocado, while others like it smooth and creamy.
              I recommend leaving it slightly chunky for the best texture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add the aromatics: </strong>Add the diced onion, chopped
              cilantro, and minced jalapeño to the mashed avocado. If you're
              sensitive to heat, start with half the jalapeño and taste before
              adding more. You can also leave the seeds in if you want it
              spicier.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fold in tomatoes: </strong>Gently fold in the diced
              tomatoes. Be careful not to overmix at this point, as you want the
              tomatoes to maintain their shape and not make the guacamole
              watery.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add optional seasonings: </strong>If using, stir in the
              cumin, cayenne pepper, and minced garlic. These additions add
              depth and complexity to the flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Taste and adjust: </strong>Taste your guacamole and adjust
              the seasoning. You may want to add more salt, lime juice, or
              jalapeño depending on your preference. Remember that the flavors
              will meld together as it sits.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Serve Immediately: </strong>Guacamole is best served
              fresh. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve with tortilla chips,
              vegetable sticks, or as a topping for tacos, burritos, or nachos.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Storage Tip: </strong>If you need to store it, press
              plastic wrap directly onto the surface of the guacamole to prevent
              browning, then refrigerate for up to 1 day. The lime juice helps
              prevent oxidation, but guacamole will naturally darken over time.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>TIP: </strong>Choose ripe avocados that yield to gentle
            pressure but aren't mushy. To ripen avocados faster, place them in a
            paper bag with a banana. For a smoother guacamole, you can pulse
            everything in a food processor, but traditional guacamole is always
            made by hand.
