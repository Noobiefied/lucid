          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p class="instructions-text">
            Here are the instructions to prepare this delacacy:
          </p>
          <ul class="instructions-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Prepare your workspace: </strong>Preheat your oven to
              375°F (190°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper
              or silicone baking mats. This prevents sticking and ensures even
              baking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mix the dry ingredients: </strong>In a medium bowl, whisk
              together the flour, baking soda, and salt until well combined. Set
              this aside while you prepare the wet ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cream the butter and sugars: </strong>In a large mixing
              bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the softened butter with
              both sugars on medium speed for about 3-4 minutes. The mixture
              should become light and fluffy with a pale color. This step is
              crucial for creating cookies with the right texture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add eggs and vanilla: </strong>Beat in the eggs one at a
              time, making sure each is fully incorporated before adding the
              next. Add the vanilla extract and mix until combined. Scrape down
              the sides of the bowl as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Combine wet and dry: </strong>Gradually add the flour
              mixture to the butter mixture, mixing on low speed just until no
              flour streaks remain. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make
              your cookies tough.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fold in chocolate chips: </strong>Using a wooden spoon or
              spatula, gently fold in the chocolate chips (and nuts if using)
              until evenly distributed throughout the dough.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Shape the cookies: </strong>Drop rounded tablespoons of
              dough onto your prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2
              inches apart to allow for spreading. For more uniform cookies, you
              can roll the dough into balls.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Bake: </strong>Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges
              are golden brown but the centers still look slightly underbaked.
              They will continue to cook on the hot pan after removing from the
              oven.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cool: </strong>Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet
              for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool
              completely. This helps them set properly without breaking.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>TIP: </strong>For chewier cookies, slightly underbake them.
            For crispier cookies, bake an extra 1-2 minutes. You can also chill
            the dough for 30 minutes before baking for thicker cookies that
            spread less.
