          <p class="instructions-text">
            Here are the instructions to prepare this delacacy:
          </p>
          <ul class="instructions-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Prepare the rice: </strong>The key to great fried rice is
              using cold, day-old rice. Fresh rice is too moist and will become
              mushy. If your rice is clumped together, break it apart with your
              hands or a fork before cooking. If you only have fresh rice,
              spread it on a baking sheet and refrigerate for at least 30
              minutes to dry it out.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Scramble the eggs: </strong>Heat a large wok or skillet
              over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl
              to coat. Pour in the beaten eggs and let them sit for about 10
              seconds, then scramble them, breaking them into small pieces. When
              just set but still slightly soft, transfer to a plate and set
              aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cook the aromatics: </strong>Add another tablespoon of oil
              to the same wok. Add the minced garlic, ginger, and the white
              parts of the green onions. Stir-fry for about 30 seconds until
              fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add vegetables: </strong>Add your mixed vegetables to the
              wok. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are tender but
              still crisp. If using frozen vegetables, make sure they're thawed
              and well-drained first.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add the rice: </strong>Push the vegetables to the sides of
              the wok and add the remaining tablespoon of oil to the center. Add
              the cold rice, breaking up any remaining clumps. Stir-fry for 3-4
              minutes, tossing and flipping constantly, until the rice is heated
              through and starting to get slightly crispy in spots.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Season the rice: </strong>Drizzle the soy sauce and oyster
              sauce over the rice. Add the white pepper. Toss everything
              together vigorously, making sure the sauces are evenly distributed
              and the rice is well-coated. The rice should take on a light brown
              color from the soy sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Combine everything: </strong>Add the scrambled eggs back
              to the wok, breaking them into smaller pieces as you toss. Add the
              green parts of the green onions and toss everything together for
              another minute.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Finish: </strong>Remove from heat and drizzle with sesame
              oil. Toss once more to distribute the sesame oil, which adds a
              wonderful nutty aroma and flavor. Taste and adjust seasoning with
              additional soy sauce or salt if needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Serve: </strong>Serve immediately while hot. Fried rice is
              delicious on its own or as a side dish to your favorite
              Asian-inspired meals.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>TIP: </strong>The key to restaurant quality fried rice is
            high heat and constant movement. Don't be afraid to really crank up
            the heat, you want that slightly smoky, charred flavor (called "wok
            hei"). Use a large enough pan so the rice isn't crowded and can get
            crispy. You can customize this recipe endlessly—add protein,
            different vegetables, or try it with pineapple for a Hawaiian twist.
