          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p class="instructions-text">
            Here are the instructions to prepare this delacacy:
          </p>
          <ul class="instructions-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Marinate the chicken: </strong>In a medium bowl, combine
              the chicken strips with 2 tablespoons soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, 1
              tablespoon cornstarch, and 1 teaspoon sesame oil. Mix well to coat
              all the chicken pieces. Let it marinate for at least 15 minutes
              while you prepare the other ingredients. This tenderizes the
              chicken and adds flavor.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prepare the sauce: </strong>In a small bowl, whisk
              together the soy sauce, oyster sauce, rice vinegar, brown sugar,
              cornstarch, chicken broth, and sesame oil. Set aside. Having your
              sauce ready before you start cooking is essential for stir-frying,
              as things move quickly once you start.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Prep the vegetables: </strong>Cut all your vegetables and
              have them ready near the stove. In stir-frying, the cooking
              happens fast, so you need everything prepared and within arm's
              reach.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cook the chiken: </strong>Heat a large wok or skillet over
              high heat until very hot. Add 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil and
              swirl to coat. Add the marinated chicken in a single layer (you
              may need to do this in batches to avoid overcrowding). Let it sear
              for about 2 minutes without moving it, then stir-fry for another
              2-3 minutes until the chicken is cooked through and lightly
              browned. Transfer the chicken to a clean plate and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Stir-fry the aromatics: </strong>Add the remaining
              tablespoon of oil to the wok. Add the minced garlic and ginger and
              stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cook the vegetables: </strong>Add the harder vegetables
              first (broccoli and carrots) and stir-fry for 2 minutes. Then add
              the bell peppers, onion, and snap peas. Continue stir-frying for
              another 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are crisp-tender. They
              should still have a bit of crunch.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Combine and sauce: </strong>Return the chicken to the wok
              with the vegetables. Give the sauce a quick stir (the cornstarch
              settles), then pour it over the chicken and vegetables.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Finish: </strong>Toss everything together for about 1-2
              minutes until the sauce thickens and coats everything evenly. The
              sauce should be glossy and cling to the chicken and vegetables.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Garnish and Serve: </strong>Remove from heat, sprinkle
              with sliced green onions, and serve immediately over steamed rice
              or noodles.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>TIP: </strong>The secret to a great stir-fry is high heat
            and quick cooking. Your wok or pan should be smoking hot. Cook in
            batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding, which causes steaming
            instead of searing. You can swap the vegetables for whatever you
            have on hand—mushrooms, zucchini, baby corn, and water chestnuts all
            work great.
