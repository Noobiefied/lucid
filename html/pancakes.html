          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p class="instructions-text">
            Here are the instructions to prepare this delacacy:
          </p>
          <ul class="instructions-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Combine dry ingredients: </strong>In a large mixing bowl,
              whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar until
              well combined and no lumps remain.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Mix wet ingredients: </strong>In a separate medium bowl,
              whisk together the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla extract
              until smooth and well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Combine wet and dry: </strong>Pour the wet ingredients
              into the dry ingredients. Using a whisk or wooden spoon, gently
              stir until just combined. The batter should be slightly lumpy—do
              not overmix! Overmixing will result in tough, dense pancakes. A
              few small lumps are perfectly fine and will disappear during
              cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Rest the batter: </strong>Let the batter rest for 5-10
              minutes while you heat your griddle or pan. This allows the baking
              powder to activate and the gluten to relax, resulting in fluffier
              pancakes.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Heat your cooking surface: </strong>Heat a griddle or
              large non-stick skillet over medium heat. Add a small amount of
              butter or spray with cooking oil. The pan is ready when a drop of
              water sizzles and evaporates quickly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Cook the pancakes: </strong>Pour about ¼ cup of batter
              onto the griddle for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the
              surface and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes. When the
              bubbles begin to pop and the bottom is golden brown, flip the
              pancake.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Finish: </strong>Cook for another 1-2 minutes on the
              second side until golden brown and cooked through. The pancake
              should spring back lightly when touched.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Keep warn: </strong>Transfer cooked pancakes to a plate
              and cover with a clean kitchen towel to keep warm while you cook
              the remaining batter. You can also keep them warm in a 200°F oven.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Serve: </strong>Stack the pancakes and serve immediately
              with butter, maple syrup, fresh berries, whipped cream, or your
              favorite toppings.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>TIP: </strong>For extra fluffy pancakes, separate the egg
            and beat the white until soft peaks form, then fold it into the
            batter at the end. Don't press down on pancakes while cooking—this
            deflates them. For consistent sizes, use a measuring cup or ice
            cream scoop.
