        <h1>Homemade Hummus</h1>
        <p class="description">
          Silky, garlicky, and ridiculously easy to make in a blender. This
          protein-packed dip costs a fraction of store-bought and tastes
          infinitely better. Customize it with roasted red peppers, herbs, or
          extra lemon.

          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <p class="instructions-text">
            Here are the instructions to prepare this delacacy:
          </p>
          <ul class="instructions-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Optional step for ultra-smooth hummus: </strong>For the
              creamiest possible hummus, remove the skins from the chickpeas.
              This is tedious but makes a noticeable difference. After draining
              and rinsing, gently rub the chickpeas between your hands or in a
              kitchen towel. The skins will slip off easily. You don't need to
              get every single one—about 75% is fine.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Process the tahini and lemon: </strong>In a food
              processor, combine the tahini and lemon juice. Process for about 1
              minute, scraping down the sides as needed. The mixture will
              initially look grainy and separated, but it will become smooth and
              creamy as it processes. This step is important for developing the
              texture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add the aromatics: </strong>Add the garlic, olive oil,
              cumin, and salt to the tahini mixture. Process for another 30
              seconds until well combined.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add the chickpeas: </strong>Add the chickpeas (peeled or
              not) to the food processor. Process for 1-2 minutes, stopping to
              scrape down the sides as needed. The mixture will be thick and
              somewhat crumbly at first.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adjust consistency: </strong>With the processor running,
              slowly drizzle in the cold water, one tablespoon at a time, until
              the hummus reaches your desired consistency. You want it smooth
              and creamy but still thick enough to hold its shape. Some people
              like it thick for scooping, others prefer it thinner for
              spreading. Add water until it's just right for you.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Process until smooth: </strong>Continue processing for
              another 1-2 minutes until the hummus is very smooth and creamy.
              Taste and adjust seasoning, adding more salt, lemon juice, or
              garlic as desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Serve or chill: </strong>Transfer the hummus to a serving
              bowl. If serving immediately, use the back of a spoon to create a
              well in the center. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with
              paprika and fresh chopped parsley. You can also add pine nuts,
              olives, or roasted red peppers as garnish.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Storage: </strong>Cover and refrigerate if not serving
              right away. Hummus will keep for up to 5-7 days in an airtight
              container in the refrigerator. The flavors actually develop and
              improve after a day. Let it come to room temperature before
              serving for the best flavor and texture.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>TIP: </strong>Quality tahini makes a huge difference—look
            for brands that are smooth and creamy, not separated or bitter. If
            your hummus tastes bland, it probably needs more salt or lemon
            juice. For variations, try adding roasted red peppers, sun-dried
            tomatoes, roasted garlic, or fresh herbs like basil or cilantro.
