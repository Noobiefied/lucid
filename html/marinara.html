        <p class="description">
          Forget the jarred stuff—this homemade marinara is incredibly easy and
          tastes like it simmered all day. Fresh garlic and herbs transform
          simple canned tomatoes into a sauce you'll want to put on everything.

            Here are the instructions to prepare this delacacy:
          </p>
          <ul class="instructions-list">
            <li>
              <strong>Prepare your tomatoes: </strong>Preheat your oven to 375°F
              (190°C). Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or
              silicone baking mats. This prevents sticking and ensures even
              baking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Heat the oil: </strong>In a medium bowl, whisk together
              the flour, baking soda, and salt until well combined. Set this
              aside while you prepare the wet ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sauté the garlic: </strong>In a large mixing bowl or the
              bowl of a stand mixer, beat the softened butter with both sugars
              on medium speed for about 3-4 minutes. The mixture should become
              light and fluffy with a pale color. This step is crucial for
              creating cookies with the right texture.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Add the tomatoes: </strong>Beat in the eggs one at a time,
              making sure each is fully incorporated before adding the next. Add
              the vanilla extract and mix until combined. Scrape down the sides
              of the bowl as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Season the sauce: </strong>Gradually add the flour mixture
              to the butter mixture, mixing on low speed just until no flour
              streaks remain. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make your
              cookies tough.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Simmer: </strong>Using a wooden spoon or spatula, gently
              fold in the chocolate chips (and nuts if using) until evenly
              distributed throughout the dough.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Adjust seasoning: </strong>Drop rounded tablespoons of
              dough onto your prepared baking sheets, spacing them about 2
              inches apart to allow for spreading. For more uniform cookies, you
              can roll the dough into balls.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Serve: </strong>Bake for 9-11 minutes, or until the edges
              are golden brown but the centers still look slightly underbaked.
              They will continue to cook on the hot pan after removing from the
              oven.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="tip">
            <strong>TIP: </strong>For a silkier sauce, use an immersion blender
            to blend it partially or completely. You can also add a splash of
            heavy cream for a creamy tomato sauce, or simmer with Italian
            sausage or meatballs for a heartier version.
